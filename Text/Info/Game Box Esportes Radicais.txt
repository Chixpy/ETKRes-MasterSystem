Game Box Série Esportes Radicais (which means Game Box Radical Sports Series) is a modified version of California Games. Four of its six events were removed and now the player can only compete in the Surfing and BMX events. The team selection (sponsorship) was also removed, as well as the ability of naming your players. Each player will get a default name (PLAY1, for instance), and the game will select teams in order (player 1 gets Maxx-Out, player 2 gets Costa del Mar, and so on). The trophy screens were also removed, so the player don't see the team logo on it. He only knows in which team he is during the event competition, when his name and team appears on the top of the screen.

Up to eight players can take turns competing in either one of the two events, or both. They can also choose to practice in one single event. 

In the Surfing event, the player must perform maneuvers on the wave as trying to keep as much time as he can inside the tube, or jumping off and on the wave. He can speed up his board by climbing and descending the wave, and can slow it down by holding button 2 while maneuvering. When his time runs out, the judges will tell him his score.

In the BMX event, the player must perform jumps and maneuvers while trying to complete the course. He can speed up his bike by pressing button 1 repeatedly and jump by pressing button two. While in the middle of a jump, pressing different directions on the d-pad will make the biker perform different kinds of jumps. The more dangerous the maneuver, the more points he gets. If he crashes three times, he's eliminated.
