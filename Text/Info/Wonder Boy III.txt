Chico

are
Bidu
(formerly
Mouse-Man)
Cebolinha
(formerly
Piranha-Man)
Magali
(formerly
Lion-Man)
and
Anjinho
(formerly
Hawk-Man)."

Each of Mônica's friends has different abilities and weapons, such as:

1. Chico Bento - Shotgun
2. Bidu - Bone and shield, can walk on walls
3. Cebolinha - Sword and shield
4. Magali - Rolling pin, attacks by swinging it in an arc.
5. Anjinho - Fire sword and shield, flies

Other characters from the comic books also appear in this game, such as Cascão (as the shop keeper), Franjinha (as the Doctor) and the great villain, Capitão Feio (formerly Vampire Dragon).

Mônica's friends can side-scroll to any place of Terra dos Monstros (Monster Land), but some places will be reachable only by a certain member of the gang, due to their specific abilities or weapons. They can attack (button 1) or jump (button 2), and you can access their statistics screen by pressing the PAUSE button. There you can equip items and weapons, as well as special attacks, such as fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes (all released by pressing down and 2 together). Enemies defeated will drop gold and keys, allowing access to new areas. Collecting stones will raise the characters' Charisma, bettering the odds of getting items and gold. At each town you reach you'll receive a password, allowing you to continue the game from that point.

All the text in game is in Portuguese.
