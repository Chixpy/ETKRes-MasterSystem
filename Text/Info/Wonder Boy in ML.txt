The master of dirt, king of slime, Capitão Feio, with the help of an army of monsters, conquered the world in a sudden strike! He wants to pollute all the world and there's just one person who can stop him: Mônica! If she fails, she'll be turned into a dirty monster and the world will be polluted for ever!

Mônica no Castelo do Dragão (which translates 
Mônica
in
the
Dragon's
Castle")
is
a
modified
version
of
Wonder
Boy
in
Monster
Land
with
Wonder
Boy's
hero
Tom-Tom
replaced
by
Mônica
a
famous
Brazilian
comic
character.
Mônica
is
this
little
chubby
toothy
and
extremely
strong
girl
who
beats
up
any
of
the
neighborhood
boys
who
dare
to
mess
with
her.
She's
always
carrying
her
stuffed
rabbit
named
Sansão
which
is
in
fact
her
strongest
weapon."

The gameplay is pretty much the same in Wonder Boy in Monster Land, with Mônica side scrolling through twelve locations. She can brandish Sansão against her enemies by pressing button 1. Through her way, Mônica must defeat monsters who will leave gold when defeated. With that money, Mônica will be able to buy new equipment (in proper stores), such as boots, shields, dresses and stuffed rabbits. By pressing button 2, Mônica can jump; jumping at certain places several times will reveal hidden items. The PAUSE button will display the statistics screen, with the amount of life and gold Mônica's carrying, as well as special items and equipment. Mônica will also usually find, at the end of each location, bosses who will drop lots of gold and a key to unlock the exit. The levels have a time limit, and Mônica needs to find hourglasses that will appear out of nowhere in order to replenish her hourglass, thus avoiding losing health. She can heal herself by buying juice or vitamin drinks at bars, or going into hospitals.

All the text in the game (dialog, items' names) is in Portuguese, except for the life and gold meters and the round end screens (which are still in English).
