The year is 2030, the place is Megalocity, the new capital built on the ashes of Tokyo, which was crushed by a meteorite thirty years earlier. Now, the recovering mankind is attacked by enemies from another dimension, the yoma. The only ones standing between the yoma and the resurrection of their demonic king are the cybernetic warriors called Borgmen.

As the Borgman Ryo, you must infiltrate the yoma's base and find your way to the G area, where their leader can be found. Before that, you are advised on the remote link by Miki, leader of the world police anti-yoma section, where to go and what to do in order to be prepared for the final showdown. In the various areas, you will find powerups such as the psycho punch, psycho gun and a shield generator. Psycho weapons expend your psycho energy, though, so they must be used conservatively. In order to leave the area and go on to the next, you must destroy the all head yoma of the area.

The game is very similar to Sega's Zillion. The main game view is in a side-scrolling platform fashion, with the top section of the screen dedicated to a 3D map of the corridor you're in, displaying approaching enemies (red for low-ranking ones and white for the top yoma), as well as a map of the entire area with its several floors. Lifts are used for travelling between the floors. The game is controlled using two joypads, with one for controlling your character and the other one dedicated to accessing the equipment menu.

Based on a TV animation series, this game was remade into Cyborg Hunter for export.
